# ARTryOnDresses
This is an augemented reality (AR) iOS application, built with echo3D Swift SDK that allows users to try on dresses virtually. Users also have the option of using their own 3D models to try on.

## Setup Application
In order to setup the app using the preselected dresses, follow these steps:
1. Open XCode or download it [here](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/).
2. Clone this repository and open in XCode on computer.
3. Go to the "Signing & Capabilities" tab in Xcode and fill out your signing information.
4. Connect your iPhone/iPad to computer.
5. Select your iPhone on the dropdown list of devices to run the demo app on.
6. Press the Play button to build and run (Note: your device must be unlocked and in Developer Mode to run).

## Run Application
- Move your phone around a horizontal surface to scan a plane.
- If the "Add" button is selected, choose an object to add and touch somewhere on your horizontal plane to add it.
- If any other edit buttons are selected such as drag, rotate, or delete, tap or drag on the object you would like to edit.
- Objects can be scaled at any time by doing the two finger pinch gesture on them.
